<p>On Sunday 8th at 3pm i'll be celebrating my birthday at my house. <br/>
It'll be a huge party with all the things necessary for a huge party so it will be better if you don't miss it!<br/>
These are some of the things i'll recommend you bring so I could allow you in:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some ballons (yes, this is very important)</li>
    <li>Something food related (so i could eat it)</li>
    <li>Hunger of course (for the leftovers)</li>
    <li>Just a simple gift. Of which i have some suggestions:
        <ol>
            <li>A car <br/>
                <img src="https://picsum.photos/120/70" alt="A car"/> <br/>
                In case you cannot afford one...</li>
            <li>A Bicycle <br/>
                <img src="https://picsum.photos/119/70" alt="A Bike"/> <br/>
                And if this is still expensive to you...</li>
            <li>A house <br/>
                <img src="https://picsum.photos/121/70" alt="A house"/> <br/>
                That would be very nice of you.</li>
        </ol>

    </li>

</ul>
